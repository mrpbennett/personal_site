I do this by using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" title=\"homebrew\">Homebrew</a>, the most awesome package manager for mac.</p>\n<p>Let's get started.</p>\n<h3>Installing Homebrew</h3>\n<p>If you haven't already it's time to get Homebrew installed. Open up your terminal of choice and paste this in and press return.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will then install homebrew allowing you to install packages.</p>\n<h3>Installing mySQL and setup</h3>\n<p>Now we have homebrew installed it is time to install mySQL to do that. Enter the following into the terminal and hit return.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">brew install mysql\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will go ahead and install mySQL for you.</p>\n<h4>General Setup</h4>\n<p>After installing mySQL homebrew will give a few options, one of them is allowing us to set the <code>root</code> password. Or simply just log in with a blank password by:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql -uroot\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would suggest setting your root password, as it's good practice.</p>\n<h4>Check that mySQL is installed</h4>\n<p>Before moving on it's best to check that the install was successful. Time to start your mySQL server.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql.server start\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you see SUCCESS! you know the install has been successful. Now It's time to log in with the root user.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql -uroot\n</code></pre>\n<p>As the password is blank this should log us in successfully and present us with <code>mysql></code> in the terminal.</p>\n<p>Let's exit the server by typing in <code>exit</code> and hitting return.</p>\n<h4>Securing the installation</h4>\n<p>To secure your installation of mySQL you enter the following <code>mysql_secure_installation</code> in the terminal.</p>\n<p>mySQL comes with a validation password plugin, but for this, we won't be using that. So when prompted just hit any key. Then enter your new password, this can be anything you like.</p>\n<p>Once set you're prompted with a few options, for me personally ill remove:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anonymous users</li>\n<li>the ability for remote login</li>\n<li>the test database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I will reload the privileges.</p>\n<h4>Creating our first local database</h4>\n<p>Now we have secured our installation, it's time to create our first local database. For this database let's use the following creds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user: test_user</li>\n<li>password: test_password</li>\n<li>database: test_database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, you're able to use anything you like, but If you're not feeling creative use the above.</p>\n<p>Let's set up our database, but first log into mySQL using the password your set above.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql -uroot -pyourpassword\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once logged in, we can create our database</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql> CREATE DATABASE app_database;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's create a user for the database</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql> CREATE USER 'test_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test_password';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Give the new user full access to the database</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test_database.* TO 'test_user'@'localhost';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now flush all privileges</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's exit our session by pressing <code>ctrl + d</code></p>\n<h4>Log into your new DB with new user</h4>\n<p>Now everything is created let's try to log into <code>test_database</code> with user <code>test_user</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql -utest_user -ptest_password\n</code></pre>\n<p>If successful we know everything has worked, and I can actually write a tutorial.</p>\n<p>Now let's try to use the <code>test_database</code> table.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mysql> USE test_database\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you don't get an error we're all good, and everything is set up correctly. To exit the database just type in <code>exit</code>.</p>\n<h4>Using a GUI to access and manage your db.</h4>\n<p>If you want to manage your db via a gui such as <a href=\"https://popsql.com/\" title=\"popsql\">PopSQL</a> you can set it up by using what we have created above like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/53u3hzg2egeu/l0u7mbdK94rkDTUq3kAvw/974f2fe74319922fae65728fcc6a246c/Screenshot_2020-07-22_at_13.08.26.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-07-22 at 13.08.26\"></p>\n<p>If you have any issues with this little tutorial, hit me up on Twitter.</p>","timeToRead":3}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"installing-mysql-via-homebrew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
