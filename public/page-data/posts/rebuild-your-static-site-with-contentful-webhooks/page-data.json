It took a bit of tweaking here and there,  as I am still new to React and GraphQL, I got there in the end though.</p>\n<p>I was clicking through my site, making sure all the posts were working as intended. I had to re-publish a post as I was having issues with images in markdown files. But my site never started a build phase within Netlfiy after I re-published the post. Whaaaaaat?!!. Why wasn't this working?</p>\n<p>After some Googling, it seemed I needed something called a webhook. I have seen the word webhook mentioned many times, but was never too sure what they did. So I also googled that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page, or web application, with custom callbacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense.  How could I get a webook to build my site in Netlify once I published or un-published a blog post?
