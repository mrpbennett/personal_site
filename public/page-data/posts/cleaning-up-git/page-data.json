However sometimes things do slip through the cracks, let’s say you have already added/committed some files to your git repository and you then add them to your <code>.gitignore</code>; these files will still be present in your repository index.</p>\n<p><code>.gitignore</code> only considers untracked files. Once a file has been committed, git will look at it regardless of if it's matched on the gitignore or not.</p>\n<h3>Simple fix</h3>\n<p>To unstage any already commited files you will need to use the following:</p>\n<p><code>git rm --cached &#x3C;file></code> or <code>git rm -r --cached &#x3C;dir></code> for directories.</p>\n<p>Use the <code>--cached</code> option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.</p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>I used the above Git command to unstage my <code>bin/</code>, <code>include/</code> directories from my virtualenv as they're not needed in the repo.</p>\n<p>But another reason you would need to unstage files from being commited, is because some files hold senstive data such as the <code>db.sqlite3</code> file that comes with Django. I got stung by this before...I did say I was a noob developer.</p>\n<p>Everyday is a school day when we're developing, always learning.</p>\n<p>More info on cleaning up your repos can be found in the docs <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm\"><code>git-rm</code> - Remove files from the working tree and from the index</a></p>","timeToRead":1}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cleaning-up-git"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
