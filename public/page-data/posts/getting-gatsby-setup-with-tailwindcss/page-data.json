The learning curve was steep as I was coming from mainly an HTML, CSS and Python background. Never really spent too much time playing with JS, apart from JQuery the much more simplified JS Library.</p>\n<p>Playing around with Gatsby and React, I started building out separate <code>.scss</code> files for each component which got harder and harder to manage. I then found TailWindCSS a utility first CSS framework, the way I styled by components changed for the better.</p>\n<p>At first, I struggled to get to grips with setting it up within Gatsby, after a few links and youtube videos I got everything set up the way I wanted and below is how I did just that.</p>\n<h2>Create your Gatsby project</h2>\n<p>Install the Gatsby CLI globally if you don't have it already</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g gatsby-cli\n</code></pre>\n<p>Create your new site and then <code>cd</code> into the directory</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gatsby new &#x3C;project-name> &#x26;&#x26; cd &#x3C;project-name>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Adding TailWindCSS</h2>\n<p>Once the project has finished building you're now able to add TailWind</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Using npm\nnpm install tailwindcss\n\n# Using Yarn\nyarn add tailwindcss\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once that has completed then add a <code>.css</code> file to your <code>src/components</code> folder to inject Tailwind's <code>base</code>, <code>components</code>, and <code>utilitiesstyles</code> into your CSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@tailwind base; \n@tailwind components; \n@tailwind utilities;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Create a TailWind config file (optional)</h3>\n<p>You can skip this bit if you want too, but I would recommend creating one as you can change the behaviour of TailWind with it. I generally use it to center my containers as a default.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx tailwindcss init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will create a file with the below structure. I have added my own file to help show how I use it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n\tcontainer: {\n\t\tcenter: true\n\t},\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration\">configuration documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Using TailWind with PostCSS</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#4-process-your-css-with-tailwind\">This</a> is where I got stuck when following the TailWind instructions on installing it. Gatsby being Gatsby there was a plugin for PostCSS, so we need to install that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install --save gatsby-plugin-postcss\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the plugin has finished installing, we need to add the config to our <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file by adding the following.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// gatsby-config.js\n{\n resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-postcss',\n\toptions: {\n \t\tpostCssPlugins: [require('tailwindcss')('./tailwind.config.js')],\n\t },\n },\n</code></pre>\n<p>This now includes the <code>tailwind.css</code> and <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, so we're able to process the CSS.</p>\n<h2>Final step</h2>\n<p>Now all that is left is to import the tailwind.css file via our <code>gatsby-browser.js</code> file by simply adding the following line.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// gatsby-browser.js\nimport \"./src/components/tailwind.css\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Purging the CSS</h2>\n<p>Now everything is set up, it's time to set up purge css so we're able to remove any unused CSS.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i --save gatsby-plugin-purgecss\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// gatsby-config.js\n{\n  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-purgecss`,\n  options: { tailwind: true }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now this should clean up your unused CSS making your site even faster!</p>\n<h2>Done</h2>\n<p>Now you're able to use TailWind within your Gatsby project with ease. Simply just add the class names to your JSX and then run <code>gatsby develop</code> to see the changes.</p>","timeToRead":3}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"getting-gatsby-setup-with-tailwindcss"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
